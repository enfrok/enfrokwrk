    <h2>Do you know about Enfrok?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Essential Node Framework Real Operating Kernel</strong> is a Web Operating System designed for performance, control, and secure Enfronisment operation.
      It allows a unique OS-like experience in the browser, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>• Desktop-style interface within your browser</li>
      <li>• Secure Enfronisment access roles and permissions</li>
      <li>• Support for integrated apps like Derter browser, Notebook, Calculator</li>
      <li>• Lock UI functionality with Enfrokian permissions</li>
      <li>• Based on real-time decision logic inspired by modern kernels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The system evolves through Enfrokian protocols, ensuring all activity within the Web OS is governed under formal behavior, secure rules, and Owner permissions.
